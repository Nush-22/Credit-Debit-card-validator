Credit Card and Debit Card Validator

This C++ project implements a credit card and debit card validator using the Luhn algorithm. The Luhn algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, most notably credit card numbers.





Features:

-Validate credit card and debit card numbers

-Support for major card types (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, etc.)

-Easy-to-use command-line interface





Requirements:

-C++11 or higher

-C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
